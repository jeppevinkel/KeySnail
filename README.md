# KeySnail

Simply run the program and start setting keybinds.

All delays are in seconds, and while changes will apply immediately, they aren't saved until the save button is used. The `Add Binding` button will add more bindings.  
The `Disable` button is in case you wish to temporarily disable the program, so it won't interrupt any typing or such.
